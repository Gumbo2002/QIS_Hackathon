Nine Qubit Morris adopts rules from the game "Nine Men Morris", whose conception is dated back to the Roman Empire. The objective of the game is to take an opponent's pieces through forming "mills" or rows of three identical pieces. Mills can be formed vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the corners. The game begins with each player having nine pieces/qubits. Each qubit is placed down in their |1> (black piece) or |0> (white piece) state with each player taking turns choosing spaces on the board.

After the initial phase, mills will be formed based not only on the orientation of pieces but also their QUANTUM STATE. Every fifth turn after the placement phase will begin with qubits being put into an equal superposition between the |1> and |0> state and gates (to be addressed in the next section) will be removed. Each turn has two phases: movement phase and gate placement phase. players will have the chance to move only their qubits which are highlighted. These qubits correspond to those used in the initial round, but it is possible to score off of another player's qubits. Gate placment phase allows players to manipulate the spin state of the qubits on the board at a specific space or set of spaces. Gates allow the player to manipulate the probability of the qubit states after each turn.

Gates are operations on the spin state of the qubits. There are a total of three gates to play: bit flip gate, hadamard gate, and controlled not gate. Bit flip gates will turn a |1> qubit into a |0> qubit and vice versa. Hadamard gates will put the qubit into an equal superposition of |1> and |0> qubits. Controlled not gates will allow the state of one qubit to influence the other: refer to the table below. Finally at the end of a turn, qubits will collapse into the |0> or |1> state. If any mills exist on the board, for either player, then the player who has obtained a mill can take one qubit from the board which belongs to the other player.

The win conditions can be modified in the settings for shorter games or restrictions on gates. Good luck and have fun!
